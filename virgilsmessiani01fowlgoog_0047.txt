20 THE MESSIANIC IDEA IN VlRGlL

But Virgil cannot stop there. His dream
would be left incomplete if it ended with
the shout of triumph. “When sturdy age
has made the child a man,” mankind will
have learnt to accept earth’s bounty, and
to force her gifts no longer3 the ground
shall no longer suffer the harrow, nor the

vineyard the pruning hook3 the merchant
shall no longer trouble the sea. Every
man's needs shall be satisfied in his own
land3 instead of dyed stuffs from Tyre‚
there shall be rams with purple and saffron
hair, and lambs with scarlet fleeces. And
with these playful coloursl the picture is
complete. The imagery‚ indeed, covers a
quite serious thought ²—the contrast between
the natural labour of the farmer and the
frauds and cruelties of trade (at a time
when every merchant ship had slaves for
a part of her cargo). But its main purpose
is to bring the reader back to the magical

occupations. lf his eye ever lighted on the poem, he
no doubt interpreted the “new Achilles '' as a compli-
ment to himself ; but 1 must confess that I find it very
hard to think that Virgil even dreamt of intending this.

¹ Far less strange to an Italian eye than to ours, as
every traveller knows.

¹ This is worked out later on in one of the noblest

passages in the Georgicr (ii. 496·531).
