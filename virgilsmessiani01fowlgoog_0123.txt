that the oracles known to Heraclitus may
have included¹ ritual matters, which were of
little interest to him, but which had a special
charm ior the prosaic Romans; and the
methods employed by the Quindecimviri may
have been such as to leave large scope for
the interpreters, like the sortes used in other
Italian oracles.¹ But it is also quite possible
that the visions of the future, which so much
impressed Heraclitus, may have been too
revolutionary for Roman conservatism3 and
for this and other reasons the Capitoline copy
of the oracles may have differed from the
Asiatic original both in the way of omission
and addition.

would agree better than the Libri Fatales (so
'far as we can conjecture their nature from
the facts mentioned by Livy), with the hints
dropped by Heraclitus? There are books

that her oracles shall be held in high honour in Latium
and be deposited in the temple ol Apollo, uses the words

(Aen. vi. 71)-

Te quoque magna manent regnis penetralia nostris ε
Hic ego namque tuas sortes arcanaque lata,

Dicta meae genti, ponam, lectosque sacrabo,

Alma, viros.
