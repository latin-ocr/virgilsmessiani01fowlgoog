30 THE MESSIANIC loen IN VIRGIL

whom Scribonia bore him early in 39 se.
was a girl, the Julia whose happiness was
to be so deeply chequered by her father’s
dynastic designs. Scribonia was divorced
upon the same day, having lost the one
strong claim she might have possessed to
the Emperor's gratitude.1 But Virgil’s
Eclogue had been already published, and
was itself, as an ante-natal ode must always
be, more concerned with the father than
the child, more indeed with the hopes ol
the world than with either father or child.

. To cancel the poem later on would have been

to draw men’s attention to Scribonia’s mis·
' fortune and the Emperor's greatest perplexity,
his want of an heir3 it was therefore allowed
to stand, enigma though it had become.²
Who could possibly have foretold the extra·
ordinary influence upon the history of the
world with which this wise and gentle silence
was destined to endue the poet? Or that the
authority derived from it would be great

¹ Dio Cassius, xlviii. 34. There can be no doubt that
this is the true interpretation ol the divorce ; it was
given first, 1 believe, by Mr Warde Fowler in 1903.

²Dr Rothstein pointed out to Skutsch a precise
parallel, an uniulfilled propheey (of an heir to Domitian)
which still survives in Martial (vi. 3).
