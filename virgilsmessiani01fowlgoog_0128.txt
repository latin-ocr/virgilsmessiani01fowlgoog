SPURIOUS ORACLES 101

Cicero (De Diu. ii. 111) argues that such an
artificial form of composition is inconsistent
with the divine frenzy ascribed to the Sibyl,
and Varro is quoted to the same effect by
Dion. Hal. (Α. R. iv. 62), as saying that
the spurious oracles may be detected by the
so-called acrostics.1

the Psalms and in the Book os Lamentations. It occurs,
however, in the Prologues to the Plautine Comedies,
written about 50 nc. (see Teuffel's Rom. Lit. 988. 2), and
