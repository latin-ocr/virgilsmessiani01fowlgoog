at the end of a purely mystical and religious
poem, to such unguarded realism as we find
in the last four lines? One may well ask,

if the infant is Dionysus and the father
Jupiter, who is the mother whom the child is
to recognise by smiling on heri M. Reinach
confesses that he cannot discover her. She
cannot be Semele: “she can never have
possessed, in the eyes ol the poet, a precise
mythological character, lor she only appears
in the last four lines and in terms which
would suit any mother. Itis best to admit
that Virgil, discarding the horrible history
of the incest of Zeus with Persephone, has
adopted a tradition, perhaps neo-Orphic in
origin, which made some nymph or other
(une nymphe quelconque) the mother oi
Dionysus-ZagreuS, or one oi the numerous
mortals loved by the chief of the gods. Il
we admit this hypothesis, all the details still
obscure seem to clear themselves up.''l If
we could admit it l I should not have quoted
these sentences if I had not wished to show
how greatly we are in danger, in these days
oi scientific criticism, oi applying wrong
methods which can only lead to absurd
