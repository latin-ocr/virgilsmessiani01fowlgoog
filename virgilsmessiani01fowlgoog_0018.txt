VlRGlL’S FOURTH ECLOGUE
WITH A VERSE TRAwsnnnow

THE following rendering is mainly the work ol Professor
Conway, but he is deeply indebted to the criticisms and
suggestions of his colleagues‚ and even more to his
former pupil, Miss F. E. Bevan‚ Headmistress of the
South Liverpool School for Girls, who genereusly put
into his hands a draft version in the same mette, from
which were taken l. 26, most of 11. 75-79, and nota
