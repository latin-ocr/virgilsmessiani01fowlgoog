σι’βυλλα meant originally the “counsel or
will of God‚'' we can see how it might be
⁴used for the utterance not only of the
Greek prophetess‚ but also of the Jewish
prophet declaring that will.

P.S.-—To those who desire further informa-
tion on this abstruse and interesting subject

Ι would especially recommend Alexandre's
exhaustive Excursus ad Sibyllina, containing
624 pages (unfortunately without an index),
which constitutes the second volume of his
first edition of the Oracula,· and next to that,
Klausen's AEneas und die Pereatere, pp. 203-
3¹23 Marquardt's Romiscize Staatsverwaltung,
vol. iii. pp. 42-54 and 336-3443 Schiirer's
Histrry of tlte Jewrlrle People div. ii. vol. iii.
pp. 270-292‚ containing a full bibliography3
and BoucheLeclercffi Histoire de la Deirina·
teon, vol. ii. 93-199. See, too, Hastings’
D. of B. vol. v. p. 66 foll. under “Sibylline
Oracles.'' It may be worth while to com-
pare the old edition of the Sibylline Books

Ulixes, Φερρέφαττα Περσεφόνη and Proserpina. And it
must be remembered that a Sybil or witch is wont to

be a foreigne13 see a notice of Wfinsch's Sethiamkche
Verfluchungstasel in Class. Rern, 1899, p 226. R. S. C.]
