Aratus,l Ονὶᾰ,2 all start with this, descending
to their own generation by a gradual decline
from golden to silver, from silver to brazen,
from brazen to iron, except that Hesiod
interpolates an age of Heroes between the
brazen and the iron. Still more plainly is
this principle of degeneration expressed by
Horace (Carm. iii. 6. 45)-

Damnosa quid non imminuit dies?
Aetas parentum peior avis tulit

Progeniem vitiosiorem ;

and by Juvenal (xiii. 28)-

Nona aetas oritur peioraque saecula ferri
Temporibus, quorum sceleri non invenit ipsa
Nomen et a nullo posuit natura metallo.

But, it may be asked, may not this imagina-
