most irrefragable of human words, and trust-
ing himself to this, as to a raft, to set forth
on the hazardous voyage of life, unless it were
possible to find a surer and less dangerous
way on board a stronger vessel‚ some word

period, Porphyry justified the publication of
his treatise on the “Philosophy to be derived
from O'raclesss’ on the ground that the use
of such a collection of the divine responses
would be understood by all who had felt the
painful craving alter truth‚ and had some·
times wished that, by receiving the mani·
festation of it from the gOdS, they might be
relieved from their doubts by information
not to be disputed (ὅσοι περὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν
