THE SIBYL AND HEBREWUPROPHECY 97

dating from a hundred years before his time,
which speak of another voice “crying in the
wilderness.’' The prophets, oi whom they

tell us, profess to speak in the name of God
and under His inspiration. The larger part
of their prophecies consists of threats of judg- ,
Ἴ ment They deal with the fate of nations and
of individuals reaching on to the end of time.
They are often confused, apparently seli-con-
tradictory, difficult to understand, mixed up
oi blessing and cursing in an inexplicable
way. Yet they have been signally successful
in raising the moral standard both in nations
and individuals. In one point they depart
from the old type as described by Heraclitus
They appeal to hope as well as to iear3 they
hold out the prospect of a final reign oi
righteousness and peace. As to the style in
which these books are written, in so far as the
original Hebrew is concerned, they might be
characterized in a good sense as ἀκαλλώπιστα
καὶ ἆμύριστας but, if we think of later Greek
translations, we should have to apply these
words in the same depreciatory sense as that
in which they seem to have been used by
Heraclitus of the Sibyllina verses current in

his time.
