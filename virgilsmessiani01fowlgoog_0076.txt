THE CHILD OF THE POEM

BY W. WARDE FOWLER

Is is now some years since Mr Mackail
warned us, in his admirable and suggestive
volume on Latin literature‚¹ that there is
no great mystery in the Fourth Eclogue,
and that it is in reality only a poem of
nature. “The enchanted light which lingers
over it is hardly distinguishable from that
which saturates the Georgr’cs. . . . It is not
so much a vision of a golden age as Nature
herself seen through a medium of strange
gold.’' We have been led astray‚ he tells
us, by ancient misconceptions of its ideas
and imagery3 the Sibylline verses which sug·
gested these “were really but the accidental
grain of dust round which the crystallisation
of the poem began.”
