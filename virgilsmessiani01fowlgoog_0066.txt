THE POET’S Nsw IDEAL 39

anticipation of a spiritual Messiah, when
Virgil declares that Augustus is the deliverer
he celebrates that Augustus’ work is to bring
the great reformationi 1f Virgil was in the
end content to accept as the Deliverer a
’ personality so full of blots, can we interpret
seriously his loftier predictions'l But such a
criticism is based on a misconception. Virgil
was not content with the past or present
weaknesses oi the particular human being
called Octavian3 he condemns roundly, as
we have seen, the violent deeds linked with
his earlier career; what Virgil extols is the
vast service1 which Augustus was visibly
rendering to mankind, and the still higher
service which seemed to lie in the new ideal
oi the Empire. ln the passage devoted to
Augustus in Aeneid vi., there is no mention
oi his triumphs in war3 his first glory is
the recall of the Golden Age oi Justice 3²

¹ This conception ol service to humanity marks alllthne
praise ol Augustus in Virgil, as 1 have shown elsewhere
(in the Proceedings of the Classical Α ssociatr'on lor 1906),
and separatos it somewhat widely from the tributes os
Propertius, Tibullus, and even of Horace ; and by a great
guli from the abominable flatteries ol Domitian in Martial.
