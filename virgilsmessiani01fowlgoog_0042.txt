THE slavo AND THE comm 15

Latin word for “child '³ is one that is
masculine in form, namely prm,- and hence
it is natural, indeed almost inevitable, that
the poet should write as if it were certain
that the child would be a boy. And it is
well to notice now that the lines which
invoke Lucina, the Goddess of Birth, and
the concluding prayer that the mother's
weary months of waiting may be happily
ended, make it quite certain (to every reader,
at least, whose sense of humour is not some-
what in abeyance) that it is not of some
mystical moral emblem, but of an actual
mother and child, that we are meant to think.

One of the sacred books of the Roman
state-religion was a selection of rhymes
and rubrics attributed to an ancient Wise

sight, but Marie Ferre, or whatever her name was, toolr
him t'or granted, sex and all-” .

To Virgil it would have seemed a discourtesy to the
parents, and more an ill omen, to speak as if there
was any doubt of the sex os the child to be; and it
was clearly essential to the whole scheme ola poem
which linlred a great reformation ol humanity to the
personality ol the child, that the poet should “take lor
granted,” the sex ol his Prince of peace.

l cannot help hoping that these considerations may
do something to modify Prol. Ramsay's strange but re·
iterated belief (see p. 58) that “a poet could not work
under such conditions‚” i.e., before the child was born.
