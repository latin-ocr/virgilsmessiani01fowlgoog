a fresh supply from a new and unexpected
source.

1 doubt if he would have been led to
this source if he had not happened on an
idea dropped by the German mythologist,
Ο. Gruppe‚¹ and abandoned by him. M.
Reinach picked up this idea, was greatly
attracted by it, and has most ingeniously
worked it out. F irst‚ he observes that the
infant of the poem is the son of Jupiter. But
is this really so? Can magnum Iovis ἐκινε-
mentum (line 49) bear this meaning? Incre-
mentum is a rare and rather vague word,
and seems chosen, in careful keeping with
the general tenor oi the poem, to express
some less direct relation than actual sonship.
When not so many years afterwards Ovid
used the word in his Metamorphoses (iii. 103),
he could hardly have failed to remember
Virgil's famous use oi it: yet he has given

¹ Gn'eclzisclze K ulte und Myrlea, i. 637 iol. ; a passage
of value for the student oi the Jewish Sibylline oracles
and their relation to the literature of the last century nc.
In comparing Sibyll. 111. 787 iol. and lsaiah xi. 6, he notes
the essentia] difference between the idea inherent in both
oi these and the language ol our poem, 18-30. On these
Sibyllines see also Schiirer'slewzlrh People in the T ime os
Chn'st, Div. ii. vol. iii. p. 271 iol. (Eug. trans.).
