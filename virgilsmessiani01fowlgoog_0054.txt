nauta, poen, Jonusou 27

Parnassus . . . . and next didst light me on
the road to God. Thou didst as one who
goes by night, who bears a light behind
him and helps not himself, but after him
makes the people wise, when thou saidst,
‘The world renews itself: justice returns
and the first age of man 3 and a new offspring
descends from Heaven.' Through thee Ι
was a poet, through thee a Christian. . . .
Already was the whole world teeming with
the true belief, sown by the messages of
the eternal realm: and thy word . . . . was
in harmony with the new preachers wherefore
Ι began to visit them. And at last they
came to seem to me so holy that when
Domitian persecuted them, their plaints
were not without tears from me. And so
long as [I was] in the world I aided them,
and their righteous manners made me hold
all other philosophies of small price. . . .
Thou then . . . . didst lift the covering that
hid from me so much good.''

In our own country it is scarcely two
hundred years¹ since Pope published his
Messialz, in the preface to which he accepts
the view of Augustine, namely, that the

¹ 1709 is the date of the Pastorals.
