TRANSLATION 5

For thee, sair Child‚ the lavish Earth shall
spread ’ 2 5
Thy earliest playthings, trailing ivy-wreaths
, And foxgloves red and cups of water-filies,
20 And wild acanthus leaves with sunshinestored.
Thegoats shall corne uncalled, weighed down with :
milla
Nor lions' roar affright the labouring lrine.
Thy very cradle, blossoming sor joy,
Shall with solt buds caress thy baby sace3
’ The treacherous snake and deadly herb shall
die,
²5 And Syr'ian spikenard blow on every bank.

But when thy boyish eyes begin to read 35 .
Rome's ancient prowess and thy sire's great story,
Gaining the power to know what manhood is, ι
Then, league by league‚ the plain without a

sovrer ’
’ Shall ripen into waves os yellow corn,-
’ On every wild-thorn purple grapes shall cluster, 40
30 And stubborn oaks yield honey clear as dew.
But in rnen's hearts some lingering seed ol ill
¹ E’en yet shall· bid thern launch adventurous keels‚
And brave ‘the inviolatesea, and wall their towns,
And cut earth's face with furrows. Then behold 45
Another Tiphys take the helm and steer
Another Argo, manned by chosen souls
(Seeking the golden, undiseoveied East]
35 New wars shall riso, and Troy renewed shall see
Another great Achilles'leap to land. 50
