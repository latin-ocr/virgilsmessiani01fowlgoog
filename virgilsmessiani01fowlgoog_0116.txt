longest voyage he had ever made. ln any
case he wrote his poems at Ascra, near
Mount Helicon, and is accordingly referred to
by Virgil as “Ascraeus senex ’⁵ (Ecl. vi. 70),
by Propertius (iii. 32. 77) as “Ascraeus
poeta‚'’ by Ovid (Am. i. 15. ιι) as
“Ascraeus ” simply, while the phrase
“Ascraeum carmen ” is used as a synonym
for pastoral poetry in general in Georg. ii. 176.
On the other hand, Virgil’s thoughts were
much occupied with the Sibyl of the Italian
Cumae, a city in the neighbourhood of which
he resided for some years of his life,1and
which is said to have been the oldest of the
Greek colonies of Italy, founded jointly by
the Euboean Chalcis and the Aeolian Cyme.
ln the Aeneid, AEneas is twice bidden
to consult this Sibyl, once by Helenus
(Aen. iii. 441-460)‚ and again by Anchises
(Aen. v. 730-736), while the Sixth Book
gives us the story of the actual visit to the
Sibyl’s grotto. So Ovid speaks of the
“Virgo Cumaea” (Met. xiv. 135), of the
“Cumaeae templa Sibyllae ’' (Met, xv. 712),
of “Cumaeos annos‚” referring to the
longevity of the Sibyl (Ex Ponto, ii. 8. 41);
