HERACLITUS ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SIBYL 93

in a different light in the famous
saying of the great Ephesian philosopher,
Heraclitus towards the end of the sixth
century (ἐκ. about the time of the expulsion
of the Roman kings), In Fragment xii. oi
Bywater's edition we read the striking words
-Σίβυλλα δέ μαινομένῳ στόματι ἀγέλαστα καὶ
ἀκαλλώπιστα καὶ ἀμύριστα φθεγγομένην χιλίων
ε’τέων ἐξικνέεται τῇ φωνῇ deci τὸν θεόν, “the
Sibyl with irenzied lips uttering things un-

lofty idea of the Sibyl in the Phaedrus,

p. 244, where, after speaking of the many
benefits public and private bestowed on man

at Delphi and the priestess at Dodona, he

¹ The genitive is used with ἐξικνεῖσθαι by Xenophon,
Anab. iii. 3, 7, ol ἀκοντισταὶ βραχύτερα ἠκόντιζον ἣ ὡς

too short to reach the slingers.'’ lu other passages the
word is better translated “to hit,'’ “to cover.’' The
meaning oi Heraclitus would thus be “covers with her
voice a thousand years,'' ιζι. utters truth bearing on far
distant ages. We may conjecture, however, from Ovid’s
“Cumaeos aun0s” quoted above, as well as from other
references, that some understood them as attributing long
lise to the Sibyl herself, “attalus a thousand years.’'
