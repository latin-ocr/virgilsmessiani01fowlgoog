cry, My father and my mother, the riches
of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
shall be carried away ” (viii. 4). Indeed
Virgil himself repeats the latter words in
the line

We go on now to consider the other details
of the new age depicted by Virgil, and, if
possible, to find out where they are taken
from. It is not necessary to fix on some

one authority to the exclusion oi all others,
nor need we expect to find perfect consistency.
Virgil is a poet, writing at the most critical
epoch of human history, with a heart and
mind open to all influenoes; and in this
poem he embodies the half-conscious hopes
and forebodings of his time. The Sibyl
was never supposed to be logical, and Virgil
here makes no attempt to reconcile the rival
claims of Apollo, Saturn and Jupiter, who
are all named as presiding over the new
age.

carminis aetas.” Servius, in his note on
Ecl. ix. 47,¹ quotes the Memoirs oi Augustus
