72 THE CHILD 01² THE POEM

passage ol Catullus² to which all editors
referor should refer us:

Torquatus, volo, parvulus
Matris e gremio suae
Porrigens teneras manus
Dulce rideat adpatrem
Semihiante labello.

I believe that Quintilian correctly copied his
MS„ which had quinon rasere parentes, and that
the qui became miin later copies throughamis- ,
understanding of the sense and the grammar,
from which Quintilian, who makes it perfectly
clear that he understood the plural qui to be
followed grammatically by the singular hunc

in the next line‚² was saved by his good taste
and poetical feeling. F urther‚ I believe that
Virgil really wrote “qui non risere parentes ”
— not parenti-and I take parentes as the
object ol msere, understanding it as some-
what colloquial Latin, asin Plautus Captivi

¹ Catull. lxi. 216101.

’“ Ex illis enim ‘qui non risere,' hic, quem non
dignata.'’ 1 cannot follow Dr Postgate in his account
of these words (Class. Rev„ Feb. 1902), nor in his
suggestion of hinc sor hunc. Quintilian had just written
Est figura etin numero, vel cum sz'ngwlan' pluralis
subjungitur. But Dr Postgepe contends that Quintilian’s
copy of Virgil was a bad oll'e.
