TRANSLATION

' Muses to whom Sicilian shephetds sang,
. Teach me a loltier strain. The hazel eopse
And lowly tamarisk will not always please.
If still the wild, lree woodland note be heard,
Our woodland song rnust suit a consul's ear. 5

Lo, the last age ol Cumae's seer has come!
5 (Again the great millennial aeon dawns.
Once more the hallowed Maid appears, once more
Kind Saturn telgas, and from high heaven descends
The firstborn child¹ of promise.) Do but thou, ro
Pure Goddess, by whose grace on infant eyes

Dayligbt first breaks, smile softly on this babe 3
(The age ol iron in his time shall eease

And golden generations fill the world.)
, E'en now thy brother, Lord of Light and Healing‚ 15
10 Apollo, rules and ends the older day. ,

Thy office, Pollio, thine‚ shall mark the year

Wherein this star begins his gloriotrs course.
Under thy banner all the stains ol ill,
That shame usyet, shall melt away and break 20
The long„ long night of universal dread.

15 For the child's hirthright is the lile os gods, ’ ·
Heroes and gods together he shall know,
And rule a world his sire has. blessed with peace.

Ψ ¹ Noua progenies denotes the expected ¹child who is
to be the first of the new and better generation.
