was what we call an accident that gave to
the author of the Fourth Eclogue such
authority among Christians that his teaching
was studied as almost an integral part of
the Christian revelation3 but it was not an

prophet, and therefore an interpreter of
Christ; and it is not the deepest students
of Virgil who have thought him unworthy
of that divine ministry.
