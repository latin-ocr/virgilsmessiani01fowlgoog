child of the poem was nota real one. How
could Virgil have used such language of an
abstraction, or of a Greek god Dionysus?
How could he have ventured on such an
allusion? To my mind, at least, the lines
are too real and tender to be applicable to l
any child but one definitely expected, and
poetically conceived by the poet as born when Ost]
the carmen comes toa close. The mother
was a real mother, the child a real child.
The latter is doubtless as Professor Ramsay
sayS, the representative oia new and better
generation3 but to be that in Roman eyes
he must be, as every Roman scholar after-
wards understood him to be, an individual
infant of flesh and bone.
Alter expressing so strong a conviction
that the parvus puer was a child actually
born or expected to be born, I may fairly
be called on to express an opinion as to
who he was. On this question 1 do indeed
hold a decided opinion, but more than an
opinion it is not possible for any one to
give, nor is it a vital matter, as far as
the poem itself is concerned, whether or

no the secret can be discovered. But I
wish to draw attention in this connexion
