the Tyndaridae in the Cr'rzs, 398: “With
what meaning, if indeed with any meaning

at all, the author of the Ciris in its present ¹
form has introduced his parody, 1 am quite '

Nettleship questions Munro's interpreta-

tion on the ground that “the thought would
be extravagant, expressing flattery which

Augustus,”² and 1 think all must agree that
to speak of the new-born child as “the promise

something quite unexampled in classical
literature. Not unexampled, however, in

¹ See below, Appendix on Incrementum. Professor
Skutsch in his Gallus und Vergil gives strong reasons
for thinking that the einr was written by Virgil's friend
and patron Gallus, and that the phrase in our Eclogue was
borrowed from him. Skutsch notes that the spondaic
hexameter is characteristic of Gallus, who uses it fifteen

three times in the 850 lines of the Eclogues.

as to speak of its “Enormitatss' Cartault’s explanation,

' “Jupiter sera grandi par la naissance d'un tel enlant”

seems to me a poor equivalent to the weighty expression
“lovis incrementum,’' as interpreted by the context in
Virgil.
