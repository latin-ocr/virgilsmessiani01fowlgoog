AUGUSTINE ΛΝΒ ΒΑΝΤΕ 25

the Sibyl had spoken of Christ (even by
repeating “prophecies that had been heard ’')
had not Virgil referred to her in this Eclogue,
—lor the reference of the Eclogue to Christ
was to his mind too patent to admit of any
reasonable doubt. So it came about that the
Dies irae (whatever its date) ranks the Sibyl
side by side with David.

Such, too, was the belief of the poet Dante.
Every one is familiar with the unique position
of honour which Virgil holds in the Divina
⁴ Commedia as the interpreter of the Divine will
and the poet's guide through two-thirds of

the unseen world. Nor is this due merely
to reverence for Virgil as a poet. Explicitly
and many times Dante ascribes to him the
’ power of converting men to a knowlege oi

divine truth.¹ At the outset‚ when Dante

facile crederem, nisi quod poetarum quidam in Romana
lingua nobilissimus antequam diceret ea de innonatione
saeculi quae in Domini nostri Jesu Christi regnum satis
concinere et conuenire uideantur, praeposuit uersum,
dicens, Ultima Cumaei iam camim's aetas.” Augustine’s
wording has the cautiori of a true scholar.

¹ On Dante’s representation ol the relation of Virgil
to Christianity,1 cannot do better than refer the reader
to the very interesting and scholarly Excursus (to which
1 am not a little indebted), in N otters Dantls Gdttlr'clre
