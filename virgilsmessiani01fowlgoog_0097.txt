70 ΤΗΕ CHILD OF THE POEM

Lucina: and then again, as the fateful moment
approaches‚ she eries, Aggredere Omagnos‚
aden‘t iam tempus, tonores: now the child
lies before her, and the sight brings her back
to the human and the present. It seems
to me that the poem gains immensely in
truth and beauty‚ showing us the true
Virgilian tenderness and pity‚ if we look at
it in this clear and undistorted light.

I have said that the vates now uses the
language of the Italian nurse. No one has
seen this so clearly, Ι think, as Mr R. C.
Seaton, in a short paper contributed to the
Classical Revzitw in 1893 (p. 199) ; and he
has also corne near to reaching what I believe
to be the true meaning of the last line of all,

it was written. But I shall be saving space
if for the present I only make reference to this
sensible little paper, and quote the lines once

more, as they stand in the new Oxford text
of Virgil edited by Mr F. A. Hirzel:

,Incipe parve puer, risu cognoscere matrem ε
Matri longa decem tulerunt fastidia menses :
incipe, parve puer: qui non risere parenti

Nec deus hunc mensa, dea nec dignata cubili est.

naissance de l’eniant.’' 1 hope my next few pages will
settle this point.
