42 THE MESSIANIC mun IN VIRGIL

And in the same vision of Anchises we
have the famous description of the duty to
which Rome is called21-

“Others l well believe with finer touch
Shall kindle breath iu lorms of bronze, and carve
Faces os marble all aglow with life ;
Others shall plead with greater eloquence, Ι
Make chart os Heaven and tell the rising stars ;
But choose thou, son ol Rome, the imperial task
Os ruling peoples 3 this shall be thy art,
Show mercy to the humble, crush the proud,
And make the nations learn the lav os peace.'’

But the fullest embodiment of this con-
ception is in the second half of the Aeneid.

The story gives us a dramatic picture of
the ideal ruler in conflict with the concrete
forces of selfishness‚ passion, and ignor-

suggests turning a wilderness into a garden ; artes, which
includes philosophie, artistic, and poetic creation as vell
as mechanica] inventions: and atterendo, which includes
every form of service rendered to one’s lellows ; nor can
the golden simplicity of the whole passage be conveyed
by any translation. ⁴
¹ Aen. vi. 847·853.

Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera,-

Credo equidem-uiuos ducent de marmore uoltus:

Orabunt causas melius, caelique meatus

Describent radio et surgentia sidera dicent:

Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento ς

Hae tibi erunt artes, pacisque imponere morem

Parcere subjectis et debellare superbos.
