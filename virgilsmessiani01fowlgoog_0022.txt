TRANSLATION 5

For thee, fair Child, the lavish Earth shall
spread ⁸ 2 5
Thy earliest playthings, trailing ivy-wreaths
, And foxgloves red and cups of water-lilios,
20 And wild acanthus leaves with sunshinestored.
Thegoats shall corne uncalled‚ weighed down with 3
milk,
Nor lions' roar affright the labouring kine.
Thy very cradle, blossoming for joy,
Shall with soit buds caress thy baby iace3
’ The treacherous snake and deadly herb shall
die,
²5 And Syr'ian spikenard blow on every bank.

But when thy boyish eyes begin to read 35 .
Rome’s ancient prowess and thy sire's great story,
’ Gaining the power to know what manhood is, ·
Then, league by league‚ the plain without a
sower ¹
Shall ripen into waves of yellow corn;
· On every wild-thorn purple grapes shall cluster, 40
And stubborn oaks yield honey clear as dew.
But in rnen's hearts some lingering seed of ill
¹ E'en yet shall· bid thern launch adventurous lreels,
And brave ‘the inviolate-sea, and wall their towns,
And cut earth’s sace with furrows. Then behold 45
Another Tiphys take the helm and steer
Another Argo, manned by chosen souls
(Seelring the golden, undiscovered Eastl
35 New wars shall nse, and Troy renewed shall see
Another great Achilles'leap to land. 50
