propheey osan unnamed child was taken by
Virgil from the Sibyl, and in her lips had
been a prediction of Christ. Pope followed
the tradition of his own church; but even
hissProtestant critic, Samuel Johnson,1 does
not seem for a moment to demur.
In all this, then, we see that the outstanding
reason for the Christian interpretation of the
ι Eclogue was the fact that the child was not

Pope made an interesting contribution to the criticism
of the Eclogue by collecting the six or seven passages in
it, and the Fifth Eclogue (which, as we now know, relates
to the deification of Julius Caesar) in which the poetical
imagery resembles that of the similar prophecies of
a regenerated world in Isaiah. Now it is true that
Virgil's snake and lions do not behave quite like
Isaiah's; true also that similar parallels can be found
without difficulty, as the commentators show, in Greek
and Latin poets; but their combination in one poem
renders at least-possible, though perhaps not very
probable‚ the ingenious theory ol Mr H. W. Garrod
(Class. Rev„ 1904, p. 37), that they were taken by Virgil
from some poem os. Pollio's own-since from Josephus it
appears that Pollio had Jewish connexions‚ and it is
possible that a Pharisee named Pollio (losephus, xv. 1. 1)
was actually related to him. The literary problem,
which seems to me distinct from the general question
of Virgil’s attitude towards Messianic doctrine. is
discussed in the third of these Essays‚ which demonstrates
the existence ol many other links in the chain between
Virgil and Jewish prophecy.
