At last, when stronger years have made thee
man
¹ The voyager will cease to vex the sea
⁸ Nor ships oi pineuood longer serve in traffic,
For every fruit shall grov in every land

40 The field shall thrive unharrowed, vines unpruned, 55
And stalwart ploughmen leave their oxen free. ²

Wool shall not learn the dyer’s cozening art,

But in the meadou, on the ram’s ovn back,

Nature shall give new colours to the fleece‚

Sost blushing glow oi crimson, gold of crocus, 6ο
45 And lamhs be clothed in scarlet as they seed.

“ Run, run, ye spindlesl On to this sulfilment

Sp'eed the world's fortune, drav the living thread.”
So heaven's unshaken ordinance declaring
ἡ The Sister 'Fates enthroned together sang. 65

Come then, dear child of gods, Jove’s mighty heir,
Begin thy high career 3 the hour is sounding.
5ο See how it shakes the vaulted firmament,
Earth and the spreading seas and depth os sky!
See, in the davning of a new creatien 70
The heart of all things living throbs with joyi
Oh, ii but lise would bring me days enough
55 And breath not all too scant to sing thy deeds,
, Not Thracian Orpheus should outdo the strain,
Nor Linus, though his mother aid the one, 7 5
His sire the other, sveet Calliope
And beautiful Apollo, Lord oi 'Song
Nay, even Pan, his own Arcadia judging,
Should, hy Arcadia’s judgment, own defeat.
