hail the coming Better Age rather than to
salute the expected infant3 and it might
remam, as it has remained, a bone of con-
tention for expositors· This is my own
feeling about the matter; each of us will
judge for himself according to his own
historical and poetical feeling.

Let me end as 1 began, with a reference
to Mr Mackail’s remarks. 1 cannot agree
with him that there is no mystery in the
poem at all; but 1 am entirely at one with
him in claiming that it should be treated
essentially as a poem and not merely as a
puzzle‚· and that it should be interpreted
as far as possible by reference to the poet's
own life and works. As a poem it should

be learned by heart and meditated on as
a whole, not merely put upon the dissecting·
board as a corpus vile for criticism.

Professor Skutsch in his book Aur Vergil‘s Frahreit,
p. 148 fob: cp. his Gallus und Vergil, 127 note, where
he alludes to this essay as independent of his own con·
clusiou. On p. 159 of the former work he points out that
Martial wrote a poem (6.3) to celebrate the birth of a
child of Domitian, and published it, though the child was
never born.
