Tun editors ol Virgil seem content for the
most part to regard this poem as merely a
hyperbolical expression of the hope that the
agreement made at Brundisium between
Antony and Octavius in the year 40 rac.
might put an end to the civil strile from which
Rome had so long suffered. The few who
have made any attempt to account for the
special features of the new era foretold by
the poet have usually assumed without proof
that these features were capable of explanation
out of the commonplaces of Greek or Roman

literature, there being, in their opinion, ι

nothing to justily Merivale’s assertion¹ that
“the glowing language in which the reign
ol happiness is depicted appropriates almost
every image, and breathes some portion of
the spirit, of the Messianic predictions.’'
